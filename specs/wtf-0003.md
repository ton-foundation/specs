# HD Keys Seed

Authors: Steve Korshakov (steve@korshakov.com)

Hierarchical Deterministic Keys are a useful feature of Bitcoin that allows you to backup a single seed phrase and have an access to virtually infinity number of keys.

There are muliple HD keys for multiple algorithms, this proposal defines how to derive root seed for any possible algorithm and withoud sacrificing root wallet key.

## Spec

To derive 64 byte seed from TON mnemonics just use seed text `TON HD Keys seed` instead of default one.
