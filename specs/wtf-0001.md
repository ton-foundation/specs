This is highly valuable specification that is needed for almost any service in the ecosystem such as: indexers, wallets and marketplaces. This specification aims to helps to declare what contract supports while being very flexible and help individual developers from moving forward.

## Spec

In order to support introspection contract should implement supports_interface GET method:

```(int...) supported_interfaces()```

Which returns list of supported interface codes.

### Interface

Interface is a list of supported get methods, internal/external messages AND expected behaviour of a contract.

`Interface definition` is in a free-form and up to interface author.

`Interface name` is some globaly unique name in a reverse domain notation, for example: `org.ton.wallets.v3.r2`. 

`Interface ID` is calculated by getting first 16 bytes of a SHA256 of `Interface name`.

For convenience  provide [online tool](https://tondev.org/tools/interface-id) for value calculation.

### Introspection Interfcace

Introspection interface is named `org.ton.introspection.v0` and it's ID id `123515602279859691144772641439386770278`. 

In order to implement it contract should implement `supported_interfaces` function.

NOTE: `123515602279859691144772641439386770278` ALWAYS have to be the first value in this list.

```func
_ supported_interfaces() method_id {
    return (123515602279859691144772641439386770278);
}
```
